# To Do app

## The To Do app

This is a simple to-do app. To-dos are saved in local storage and always loaded from there (no synchronization between multiple devices). To-dos can be created, marked as completed, and deleted. Two themes are available: light and dark.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DigitaleWeltLibrary/to-do-app
